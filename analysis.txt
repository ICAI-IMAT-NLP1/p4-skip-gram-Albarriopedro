The SkipGram model successfully grouped similar words together. Numbers appeared close in the embedding space, showing that the model captured their shared usage patterns. Determiners like "the" and "a" were also well clustered, as well as pronouns such as "he" and "she." Additionally, some words related to specific topics, like historical and political events, formed meaningful groups. Despite minor noise in low-frequency words, the model learned useful semantic relationships.
